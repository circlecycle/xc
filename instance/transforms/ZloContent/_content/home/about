<i><b>Abstraction is the way...</b></i>
...and XML is just the "assembly language" of the internet.

<b>Please note this site is a work in progress, and is being updated daily. Since this site is running on a built-from-scratch system, it is only now being leveraged and documented.</b>

Welcome to my little corner of the web. Here you can find out about myself, my recent projects, and little trivia about this thing called XC. Over the past year and half the concept and execution of a successor to ZPT (Zope Page Templates) has been performed unceasingly, after discovering that there really should <i>be</i> a successor. Once this path was taken, there was no going back... Now, what templating system takes a year and a half to write? The answer: one that intends to be around for a very long time! While browsing this site, you might answer a poll or two, leave a comment <i>(honk if you love laszlo)</i> and perhaps - in the back of your mind - ponder on what an XML compiler might be like, if the concept was taken as far as it could go... would it be pretty? would it be useful? Would it help to wade through the rough angle bracket seas?

If you are interested in python, object-databases, elegant and compact syntax and a batteries included philosophy - you might not need to wait to long to find out!

If you are an employer interested in developing with python, openlaszlo, the ZODB, or other web-based toolsets or technologies, perhaps you'll you find a part of your answers - especially on managing complex web applications. I'm available to work in these and other related fields.

I'm 28 and have lived in the Washington, DC for 23 years. Feel free to get in touch, and most of all, enjoy a fresh outlook on XML offered with the XC Engine.

(please note - the opensourcing of this project is dependent on creating tutorials and documentation. Please check back for the 0.9 release of the engine!)
