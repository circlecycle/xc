Currently i'm developing the framework that drives this site, called XC. Past projects (discontinued) include:<br/><br/>

- <b>Data Visualizer</b> for physics application using pythoncard<br/><br/>
- Various <b>CMS installations</b> using Plone<br/><br/>
- Several <b>"ancestor" templating systems</b>, mostly for automating dreamweaver developement under e-training use cases<br/><br/>
- <b>TreeSound</b> - a tree-like interface for iterative csound development, which was never released.<br/><br/>

I'm most comfortable working in python. As a design tool, <i>i love namespaces</i>. I've generally moved towards building two types of software: interface/data visualization frameworks, and text processors for everything under the sun. A good motto I mostly live by is "I don't do one-offs", which simply means that i like to solve problems more then i like creating content. Well, that's how the cookie crumbles!<br/><br/>

Feel free to email if this sounds like something you do too!
