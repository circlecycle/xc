<b>Download the open-sourced XC System</b>

The XC Project is pleased to offer a version of this new tool for the opensource community. As the 0.7.0 version of the system, it represents a stable although less documented form of the tool for early adopters and testers. It is licensed under a version of the QT License, and this text is available with the download. The author asks that initial users of the system remain in close contact with the author to iron out installation procedures and the base set of XC code delivered with the toolkit.
